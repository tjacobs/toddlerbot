"""Locomotion and movement control for ToddlerBot.

This package contains implementations for various locomotion strategies and
movement patterns for the ToddlerBot humanoid robot, including:

- Walking gaits using reinforcement learning (PPO) and classical control
- Cartwheel and acrobatic movement patterns
- Crawling and low-profile locomotion
- Balance and stability control
- Environment interaction and terrain adaptation

The locomotion modules support both MuJoCo-based training environments
and real robot deployment, with configurable parameters for different
robot configurations and movement requirements.

Key components include environment definitions, training configurations,
reward functions, and policy interfaces for various locomotion behaviors.
