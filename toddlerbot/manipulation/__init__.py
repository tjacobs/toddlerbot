"""Manipulation and grasping capabilities for ToddlerBot.

This package provides functionality for robot manipulation tasks, including:

- Teleoperation data collection and processing
- Diffusion-based manipulation policy training
- Dataset utilities for manipulation learning
- Model architectures for action prediction
- Inference and deployment tools for manipulation policies

The manipulation framework supports learning from demonstration through
teleoperation, with tools for data collection, processing, and neural
network training using diffusion models for robust manipulation policies.

Key components include dataset management, model training pipelines,
and inference classes for real-time manipulation control.
