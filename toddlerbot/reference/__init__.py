"""Reference motion generation and trajectory planning for ToddlerBot.

This package provides reference motion generators and trajectory planning
utilities for various robot behaviors and movements, including:

- ZMP-based walking reference trajectories
- Cartwheel and acrobatic motion references
- Crawling and low-profile movement references
- General motion reference framework and base classes
- Trajectory interpolation and smoothing utilities

The reference motion system provides target trajectories for various
controllers and policies, supporting both scripted motions and
dynamically generated reference patterns based on user commands
and environmental conditions.
