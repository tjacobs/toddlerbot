"""Sensing and perception modules for ToddlerBot.

This package provides interfaces and implementations for various sensors used
in the ToddlerBot system, including:

- IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) for orientation and acceleration sensing
- Cameras for vision and depth perception with AprilTag detection
- Force Sensitive Resistors (FSR) for contact detection
- Microphone and speaker interfaces for audio processing
- Other specialized sensors for robotic applications

The sensing modules provide consistent interfaces for both simulated and
real hardware sensors, enabling seamless integration across different
deployment environments.
