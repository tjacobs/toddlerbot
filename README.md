ToddlerBot is a low-cost, open-source humanoid robot platform designed for scalable policy learning and research in robotics and AI.

This codebase includes low-level control, RL training, DP training, real-world deployment and basically EVERYTHING you need to run ToddlerBot in the real world!

Built entirely in Python, it is **fully pip-installable** (python >= 3.10) for seamless setup and usage!

## We have released ToddlerBot 2.0!
See [Changelog](CHANGELOG.md) for the list of new features and a migration guide from 1.0 to 2.0.

## Setup
Refer to [this page](https://hshi74.github.io/toddlerbot/software/01_setup.html) for instructions to setup.


## Walkthrough

- Checkout `examples` for some scripts to start with. Many of them run on a real-world instance of ToddlerBot.

- The `motion` folder contains carefully crafted keyframe animations designed for ToddlerBot. For example, you can run

    ```
    python toddlerbot/policies/run_policy.py --policy replay --path motion/push_up_2xc.lz4 --vis view
    ```

    to see the push up motion in MuJoCo. You're very welcome to contribute your keyframe animation to our repository by
    submitting a pull request!

- The `scripts` folder contains some utility bash scripts.

- The `tests` folder have some tests that you can run with 

    ```
    pytest tests/
    ``` 

    to verify our installation.

- The `toddlerbot` folder contains all the source code. You can find a detailed API documentation [here](https://hshi74.github.io/toddlerbot/sections/06_api.html).


## Submitting an Issue
For easier maintenance, we will ONLY monitor GitHub Issues and likely ignore questions from other sources.
We welcome issues related to anything weâ€™ve open-sourced, not just the codebase.

Before submitting an issue, please ensure you have:
- Read the [documentation](https://hshi74.github.io/toddlerbot), including the [Tips and Tricks](https://hshi74.github.io/toddlerbot/sections/05_tips_and_tricks.html) section.
- Checked the comments in the scripts.
- Carefully reviewed the assembly manual.
- Watched the assembly videos.

If we determine that your issue arises from not following these resources, we are unlikely to respond. 
However, if you have found a bug, need support for any open-sourced component, or want to submit a feature request, 
feel free to open an issue.

We truly appreciate your feedback and will do our best to address it!
